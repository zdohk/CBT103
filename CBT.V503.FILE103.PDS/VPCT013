%ADMGDF+ This is the option you should specify if you are transferring a file
         from GDDM to use at the work station, and conversely.  It calls the
         ADMUPC utility that converts GDDM GDF object files to PIF files, and
         conversely.  Refer to the GDDM Base Programming Reference for more
         details.

%ASCII+ This specifies that a file should be stored in ASCII when it is
        transferred to the personal computer session, but converted to EBCDIC
        when it is transferred to the host session. %If you are transferring a
        text file, use ASCII so that the file is readable.+

%CRLF+ Specifies that carriage return/line feed characters are recognized as
       record separators.  They are deleted before storing on the host session,
       and inserted again before storing on the personal computer session. %If
       you are transferring a text file, use CRLF so that the file is readable.+
