%APPEND+ Allows you to add a personal computer file to the end of a dataset, or
         a dataset to the end of a personal computer file.  APPEND may not be
         specified for members of a partitioned data set.

%BLKSIZE(n)+ When you are%sending+a file, BLKSIZE specifies the block size of
             the host dataset (n is the number of bytes in a data block).  If it
             is omitted, BLKSIZE is assumed to be the same as LRECL for new
             datasets.  If you are adding to, or replacing a dataset, BLKSIZE is
             the same as that of the existing dataset.
