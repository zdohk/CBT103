%filename+ is the personal computer filename.  A filename must be included.  It
           can be from one to eight characters long.

%.ext+ is the optional personal computer filename extension.  An extension
       starts with a period, and has one to three characters.  It immediately
       follows the filename.

%id:+ must be specified if you have more than one host session in your system
      (e.g., PC3270).  It is the short name of the TSO session window.  If you
      do not specify id: but have more than one host session, the file is
      transferred to the first host session that was created on your system (not
      necessarily the first in alphabetic order).
