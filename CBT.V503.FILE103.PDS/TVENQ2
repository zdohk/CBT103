 below the command line displayed the nature of the request:

 &T1                                                                           +

        resouce is to be owned exclusively by the owner.

          satisfied, WAITING means the requestor is waiting for the resource.

         on which the requestor is running, SYSTEMS are for all systems in the
         GRS configuration.

%MAJOR+- the major name of the resouce (e.g., for a dataset ENQ, "SYSDSN").

%MINOR+- the minor name of the resouce (e.g., for a dataset ENQ, the dataset
         name).
