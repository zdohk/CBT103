 where:

%a:+ is the fixed disk or diskette drive holding the GCP or emulation system.
     You need to specify this only if the DOS prompt is incorrect.

%d:+ specifies the fixed disk or diskette drive that either holds the personal
     computer file to be sent, or will hold the received file.  If it is not
     specified, the default drive (the drive holding the GCP or emulation
     system) is assumed.

%{path}+ is the optional personal computer DOS directory search order that sets
         the command search path through directories.  For further information,
         refer to DOS Reference.
